# [Molecule Of The Month Browser](https://github.com/jimandreas/MotmBrowser#molecule-of-the-month-browser)

This Android app presents information downloaded from RCSB.org - specifically it
supports browsing of the excellent Molecule of the Month (MotM) feature:

http://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/motm-about

The MotmBrowser contains a 3D viewer for viewing the featured [RCSB Protein Data Bank] (PDB) molecules.
This viewer is under continuous development.
